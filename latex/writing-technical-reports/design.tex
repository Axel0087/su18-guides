\subsection{Design}

\label{sec:design}

In this section you should give a high-level overview of your solution, and
argue why you chose this design over others. You should use high-level
notation, without delving into implementation details.

For instance, draw a diagram over the essential parts of your program (e.g.
using UML), write the pseudo-code for the algorithms you used, and give
abstract descriptions and illustrations of the data structures you used.
Contrast this with other possible architectures, algorithms, and data
structures.
