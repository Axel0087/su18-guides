# Forking DIKUArcade

DIKUArcade is _under active development_. This guide tells you how to follow
along.

You should work on your extension in a *private* fork of DIKUArcade. You should
not be sharing the code you write with other groups: Doing so entails
*plagiarism*.

Beware: _Breaches of the above policy will be handled in accordance with the
standard disciplinary procedures._

## Merging Upstream

One option is to merge upstream onto your current, private fork. Exercise Set 4
provides a guide on how to do this.

## Create a Private Fork

* Go to https://git.dikunix.dk/su17/DIKUArcade.
* Click "Fork".
* Select your Group.
* Click on the gear icon in the top-right corner.
* Click Edit Project.
* Under "Project Visibility" select "Private".
* Click "Save changes" to apply the above.

## Create a New Private Fork

If you already have a private fork of DIKUArcade the above steps alone will not
work, and clicking on "Fork" above will just send you to your current fork. You
must first rename your project and remove the fork relationship.

If your DIKUArcade fork is currently called `DIKUArcade`, and it contains the
solution to exercise set 3, your group *owner*, or *master* should proceed as
follows:

* Go to your DIKUArcade project on GitLab.
* Click on the gear icon in the top-right corner.
* Click Edit Project.
* Scroll down to "Rename repository".
* Change the project name *and* path to `E3-DIKUArcade`.
* Click "Rename project" to apply the above.
* Scroll down to "Remove fork relationship", and click "Remove fork relationship".

Proceed to fork DIKUArcade again, as described above.
