This document contains suggestions on how to structure a technical report
describing the implementation of a small programming project. This document
\emph{does not} intend to cover how to structure a technical report for a large
software development project, beyond the scope of our Software Development
course.

\medskip

The software you write, in this course, and beyond, will typically address a
particular problem. The job of a technical report is to give an overview of
your solution, explain the structure of your program, and tell the reader how
to work with it. Your report is an exhibit of in-how-far you have understood,
and solved the given problem. Technical reporting is an indispensable part of
\emph{sustainable} software development.

This guide is heavily based on the many guides that came before
it\cite{sestoft2002, foerstehjaelp2005, julegave1996, kunst2007}. We encourage
you to read these at your leisure. As with other guides, this guide is a social
construct.  It may be imprecise, and you may deviate when deemed necessary.
However, please respect that this guide is based on the long-lived experience
of those that came before you (and before us).
